## Overview

<img src="figs/overview.png" height="192">

My attempt to reproduce graph classification results from recent papers [[1](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJePRoAct7), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01287)] using Graph U-Net. So far, my results using Graph U-Net are worse than the baseline (GCN).

I also compare to our recent work on **Multigraph GCN (MGCN)** and **Multigraph ChebNet** [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09595)]. More results are presented in Table 1 of [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09595)].

**Update:**

- Added support of one-hot node degree features by using the `--degree` flag.
- Added support of the COLORS and TRIANGLES datasets from our recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02850).
Note that many features like unsupervised/supervised attention are not supported in this repo, see the original [graph_attention_pool](https://github.com/bknyaz/graph_attention_pool) repo for all experiments.

Examples:

```bash
python graph_unet.py -D COLORS-3 --folds 1 -gc
python graph_unet.py -D TRIANGLES --folds 1 -gc --degree
```

### Data
This repository contains all necessary data for the PROTEINS dataset. It can be found [here](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/people/morris/graphkerneldatasets/) along with similar datasets or in the [data](data) folder of this repo.

Dataset statistics and references to papers are available at [here](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets).


### Models
The baseline model is Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) [[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)].
The decoder part of Graph U-Net is not implemented yet in our code, i.e. the only difference with the baseline is using pooling based on dropping nodes between graph convolution layers.

Hyperparameters are taken from [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01287)], but learning rate decay and dropout is also applied. The readout layer (last pooling layer over nodes) is also simplified to just `max` pooling over nodes.
All hyperparameters are the same for the baseline GCN, Graph U-Net and Multigraph GCN (MGCN) except for the last row in the tables, in which case hyperparameters from [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09595)] are used.

Implementation is very basic without much optimization, so that it is easier to debug and play around with the code.

```bash
python graph_unet.py --model gcn  # to run baseline GCN
python graph_unet.py --model unet  # to run Graph U-Net
python graph_unet.py --model mgcn  # to run Multigraph GCN
python graph_unet.py --model mgcn -K 2  # to run Multigraph ChebNet with filter scale K = 2
```

To use the [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) data loader, add flag `--torch-geom` or `-g`.

Repeating 10 times for different seeds (as we do in our paper [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09595)]):
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do seed=$(( ( RANDOM % 10000 )  + 1 )); python graph_unet.py --model gcn --seed $seed | tee logs/gcn_proteins_"$i".log; done
```

Then reading log files can be done as following:
```python
results_dir = './logs'
acc = []
for f in os.listdir(results_dir):
    with open(pjoin(results_dir, f), 'r') as fp:
        s = fp.readlines()[-1]        
    pos1 = s.find(':')
    acc.append(float(s[pos1+1:s[pos1:].find('(') + pos1]))
print(len(acc), np.mean(acc), np.std(acc))
```

## Results

Average and std of accuracy for 10-fold cross-validation (left column). We also repeat experiments 10 times (as shown above) for different random seeds and report average and std over those 10 times (right column).

<sup>1</sup>
Using hyperparameters from our paper [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09595)] as below:

```for i in $(seq 1 10); do seed=$(( ( RANDOM % 10000 )  + 1 )); python graph_unet.py -M mgcn -K 2 -f 32,32,32 --n_hidden 96 --bn --epochs 50 --lr_decay_steps 25,35,45 --lr 0.001 --seed $seed | tee logs/mcheb_proteins_"$i".log; done```

Some datasets contain additional float-valued node attributes, which can improve graph classification a lot.
Note that some algorithms, including Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) Graph Kernels, are not able to make use of these
additional attributes, so algorithms should be compared fairly.

| Model                 | ENZYMES | ENZYMES + continuous node attributes (run with the `-c` flag)
| --------------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| GCN [[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)] | 32.33 ± 5.07<sup>1</sup> | 51.17 ± 5.63<sup>2</sup> |
| Graph U-Net [[1](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJePRoAct7), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01287)] | 33.00 ± 4.88 | 48.33 ± 6.32 |
| Multigraph GCN (MGCN) [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09595)] | 40.50 ± 5.58 | 59.83 ± 6.56 |
| Multigraph ChebNet (K=4) [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09595)]  | 57.33 ± 6.88 |	62.83 ± 6.15 |
| Multigraph ChebNet (K=4) [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09595)]  | 61.00 ± 4.78 <sup>3</sup> | 66.67 ± 6.83<sup>4</sup> |

These results were obtained by running (similarly for Graph U-Net, MGCN and Multigraph ChebNet):

<sup>1</sup>
```python graph_unet.py -D ENZYMES -f 128,128,128 --n_hidden 256 --lr 0.0005 --epochs 100 --lr_decay_step 150 -g```

Here, `lr_decay_step` can be any number larger than the number of epochs to avoid learning rate decay.

<sup>2</sup>
Same as above but with the `-c` flag.

<sup>3</sup>
Using hyperparameters from our paper [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09595)] as below:

```python graph_unet.py -D ENZYMES -M mgcn -K 4 -f 32,64,512 --n_hidden 256 --n_hidden_edge 128 --bn --lr 0.001 --epochs 50 --lr_decay_steps 25,35,45 -g```

<sup>4</sup>
Same as above but with the `-c` flag.
